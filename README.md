This is a NodeJS-based that project uses [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing node dependencies.
After making sure you have it installed, run `yarn` to install dependencies.

Run `make` to download and generate necessary spatial data files.

Run `yarn start:dev` to start a local server that will reload on code changes.

Run `yarn start` to run the server without automatic restarting.
